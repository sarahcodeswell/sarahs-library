## Main Element: Open Book Icon

**Step 3: Find Book Icon**
1. Click "Elements" in left sidebar
2. Search for: **"open book line art"** or **"book outline"**
3. Look for:
   - Simple, clean line drawing
   - Open book (pages visible)
   - Minimal detail
   - NOT filled/solid - outline style works best

**Recommended search terms to try:**
- "open book line"
- "book outline icon"
- "minimalist book"
- "book line drawing"

**Step 4: Style the Book Icon**
1. Select the book icon
2. **Size:** Resize to approximately **400-500 pixels wide** (should be large and centered)
3. **Color:** Click on the icon → Change color to `#5F7252` (brand green)
   - If icon has multiple parts, color them all the same green
4. **Stroke weight:** If the icon looks too thin, try to find a bolder version or:
   - Look for "Effects" → "Outline" to thicken lines
   - Aim for lines that are **8-12 pixels thick** minimum
5. **Position:** Center the book icon on the canvas with generous padding from edges

---

## Accent: Heart Icon

**Step 5: Add Heart**
1. In "Elements", search for: **"heart"** or **"heart outline"**
2. Choose a simple heart that matches the style of your book icon:
   - If book is outlined, use outlined heart
   - If book is filled, use filled heart
3. **Size:** Approximately **100-120 pixels** (smaller than the book)
4. **Color:** `#c96b6b` (dusty rose/pink)
5. **Position:** Place heart to the **upper right** of the book, slightly overlapping or floating beside it
   - Should look like the heart is "coming from" the book
   - Not touching the edges of the canvas

**Positioning tip:** The heart should feel connected to the book but not crowded

---

## Final Adjustments

**Step 6: Composition Check**
- Ensure book + heart are **centered as a group**
- Check that there's at least **150-200 pixels of padding** from all edges
- The composition should feel balanced and not cramped
- Test how it looks when zoomed out (this is how it appears as a thumbnail)

**Step 7: Visual Balance**
- Book should be the dominant element
- Heart should be noticeable but secondary
- Plenty of breathing room around the mark
- Clean, simple, recognizable
