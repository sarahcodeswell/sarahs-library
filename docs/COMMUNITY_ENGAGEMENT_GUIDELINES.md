# Community Engagement Guidelines

## Our Vision

Sarah's Books is a community built on a shared love of reading. We're here to help each other discover great books, share recommendations thoughtfully, and connect over stories that move us.

These guidelines help us maintain a welcoming, respectful space where genuine book discovery thrives.

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Neighborly
Treat others with kindness and respect. We're all here because we love books—let that shared passion guide your interactions.

### 2. Stay Book-Focused
Keep conversations centered on books, reading, and literary discovery. This isn't social media—it's a space dedicated to the joy of reading.

### 3. Respect Diverse Perspectives
Books mean different things to different people. Respect that others may have different tastes, interpretations, and reading experiences than you.

### 4. Share Thoughtfully
When recommending books or sharing opinions:
- Be honest but kind in your reviews
- Provide context for your recommendations
- Respect spoiler-free experiences for others
- Focus on what makes a book meaningful, not just what's wrong with it

## Community Standards

### What We Encourage
- **Genuine recommendations**: Share books you've actually read and loved
- **Thoughtful reviews**: Help others understand why a book resonated with you
- **Constructive discussions**: Engage in respectful conversations about books and reading
- **Support for local bookstores and libraries**: Champion the places that make reading communities thrive
- **Curiosity and discovery**: Be open to books outside your usual preferences

### What We Don't Allow
- **Harassment or abuse**: No personal attacks, bullying, or targeted harassment
- **Hate speech**: No content that promotes hatred or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected characteristic
- **Spam or self-promotion**: No unsolicited advertising, promotional content, or repetitive messaging
- **Misinformation**: No deliberately false or misleading information
- **Inappropriate content**: No sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise inappropriate content
- **Impersonation**: No pretending to be someone else or misrepresenting your identity
- **Platform manipulation**: No attempts to game the system, create fake accounts, or artificially inflate engagement

## Read with Friends Feature (Coming Soon)

When our Read with Friends feature launches, additional guidelines will apply:

### Direct Messaging
- Keep conversations book-related and respectful
- Don't send unsolicited messages to people you don't know
- Respect when someone doesn't want to engage
- Report any inappropriate messages immediately

### Friend Connections
- Only connect with people you actually know or have a genuine shared interest with
- Don't use the platform to collect contacts or build follower counts
- Respect privacy—don't share others' recommendations without permission

### Age Requirements
The Read with Friends feature is only available to users 18 and older to ensure a safe, appropriate community experience.

## Curator Guidelines (Coming Soon)

If you become a curator, you'll have additional responsibilities:

### Curation Standards
- Only curate books you've actually read
- Provide honest, thoughtful descriptions of themes
- Ensure your themes are well-organized and helpful to readers
- Keep theme descriptions appropriate and book-focused

### Curator Conduct
- Maintain the same community standards in all your curation work
- Be responsive to feedback about your themes
- Don't use curator status for self-promotion or commercial purposes

## Moderation & Enforcement

### Our Approach
We believe in light-touch moderation that preserves the spirit of genuine book discovery while maintaining community standards.

### What Happens If Guidelines Are Violated
Depending on the severity and frequency of violations, we may:
1. Issue a warning and request that you review these guidelines
2. Temporarily restrict certain features (like Read with Friends or curation)
3. Suspend your account temporarily
4. Permanently remove your account

We'll always aim to be fair and transparent in our moderation decisions.

### Reporting Issues
If you see content or behavior that violates these guidelines:
- Use the report feature (when available)
- Email us at hello@sarahsbooks.com with details
- We review all reports and take appropriate action

## Privacy & Data

- We never sell your data
- Your reading preferences are used only to provide better recommendations
- You can export or delete your data at any time

## Changes to These Guidelines

We may update these guidelines as our community grows and evolves. We'll notify you of significant changes and give you the opportunity to review them.
